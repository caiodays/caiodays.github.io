Oi! I’m Caio Dias, a Brazilian tech enthusiast with a passion for coding that started when I was just 12. Imagine this: no internet, a CD packed with Delphi trojan codes, and a curious kid with way too much time on his hands. That’s how my love affair with development began, and it’s been a wild ride ever since.

I went on to study Computer Information Systems at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP) and even spent a year at Ohio University, diving deep into all things tech (and maybe a bit of American culture too). My career took me across borders, including over a year in Argentina, where I had the chance to work, explore, and, of course, improve my *Castellano*.

In the world of consulting, I’ve been all about data science—building machine learning models to predict car insurance prices, detect healthcare fraud, and help banks offer the perfect product for each client. It’s been challenging, rewarding, and downright fun.

Nowadays, I’m the Director of Software and Data at Shape Digital, but my love for coding never faded. This blog is my way of getting back to my roots, sharing what I learn, and maybe even breaking a few things along the way.
